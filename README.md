### ⚙️ JavaScript (JS)

> JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.

> It enables features such as form validation, animations, event handling, content updates without page reloads (AJAX), and much more.

> JavaScript runs directly in the browser through the JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome), allowing it to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page via the DOM (Document Object Model).

> It can be written directly inside HTML files using `<script>` tags or linked externally as `.js` files.

> Modern JavaScript supports modular coding, asynchronous programming (via promises and `async/await`), and is widely used with frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js for full-stack development.
